# Streaming Improvements

## üöÄ **Controlled Streaming for Better Readability**

### **1. Balanced Streaming Speed**
- **Controlled delays** for readable streaming (15ms between chunks, 10ms between steps)
- **Responsive UI** with optimized polling (2.5s intervals)
- **Stable message handling** to prevent text disappearing
- **Configurable timing** for easy adjustment

### **2. Enhanced Message Stability**
- **Improved input handling** to prevent text from disappearing
- **Better state management** for sending messages
- **Controlled timing** for input clearing and message sending
- **Enhanced error handling** with quota detection

### **3. Optimized Performance**
- **Balanced responsiveness** without sacrificing readability
- **Stable UI updates** with proper debouncing
- **Better request handling** with shorter timeouts
- **Enhanced error recovery** for quota issues

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Current Configuration**

The streaming is now configured for optimal balance between readability and responsiveness:

```typescript
export const STREAMING_CONFIG = {
  // Stream speed control (in milliseconds)
  STREAMING: {
    CHUNK_DELAY: 15, // Delay between stream chunks for readability
    STEP_DELAY: 10, // Delay between AI steps for readability
  },
  
  // Chat polling intervals (in milliseconds)
  POLLING: {
    REFETCH_INTERVAL: 2500, // How often to check stream state
    STALE_TIME: 1500, // How long to keep data fresh
    GC_TIME: 5000, // How long to keep cache
  },
  
  // UI debouncing (in milliseconds)
  DEBOUNCE: {
    RUNNING_STATE: 400, // Debounce for running state changes
    MESSAGE_SENDING: 50, // Delay before clearing input
    SENDING_RESET: 500, // Time to reset sending state
  },
  
  // Request deduplication (in seconds)
  DEDUPLICATION: {
    REQUEST_TIMEOUT: 10, // How long to track duplicate requests
    MAX_ATTEMPTS: 60, // Max attempts to wait for stream cleanup
    ATTEMPT_DELAY: 500, // Delay between cleanup attempts
  }
};
```

## üéØ **Key Improvements**

### **1. Readable Streaming**
- **15ms delay** between stream chunks for better readability
- **10ms delay** between AI processing steps
- **Controlled speed** that's neither too fast nor too slow

### **2. Stable Message Handling**
- **Prevents text disappearing** when sending messages
- **Better input state management** with proper timing
- **Controlled message sending** with delays to ensure stability

### **3. Responsive UI**
- **2.5-second** polling intervals for good responsiveness
- **400ms debouncing** for stable state updates
- **1.5-second stale time** for fresh data

### **4. Enhanced Error Handling**
- **Detailed quota violation detection** and logging
- **Automatic retry delay extraction** from API errors
- **Better error recovery** and user feedback

## üîß **How to Adjust Speed**

### **Make Streaming Faster:**
```typescript
STREAMING: {
  CHUNK_DELAY: 5, // Reduce from 15ms
  STEP_DELAY: 5,  // Reduce from 10ms
}
```

### **Make Streaming Slower:**
```typescript
STREAMING: {
  CHUNK_DELAY: 25, // Increase from 15ms
  STEP_DELAY: 20, // Increase from 10ms
}
```

### **Adjust UI Responsiveness:**
```typescript
POLLING: {
  REFETCH_INTERVAL: 2000, // Faster updates
  STALE_TIME: 1000, // Fresher data
}
DEBOUNCE: {
  RUNNING_STATE: 300, // Faster state changes
}
```

## ‚úÖ **Testing**

The improvements have been tested to ensure:
- ‚úÖ AI responses are readable and not too fast
- ‚úÖ Text doesn't disappear when sending messages
- ‚úÖ UI is responsive and stable
- ‚úÖ No duplicate message sending
- ‚úÖ Smooth streaming experience
- ‚úÖ Enhanced quota error detection

## üöÄ **Result**

Your chat now provides an optimal user experience with:
- **Readable streaming speed** (not too fast, not too slow)
- **Stable message handling** (no disappearing text)
- **Responsive UI** with proper timing
- **Enhanced error handling**
- **Easy configuration** for fine-tuning
