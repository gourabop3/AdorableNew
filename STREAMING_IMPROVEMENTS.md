# Streaming Improvements

## üöÄ **Updated to Match AdorableNewOp Repository**

### **1. Faster, More Responsive Streaming**
- **Removed artificial delays** for real-time streaming
- **Faster polling intervals** (2 seconds instead of 3)
- **Reduced debouncing** (300ms instead of 500ms)
- **Direct stream processing** without slowStream wrapper

### **2. Enhanced Error Handling**
- **Advanced quota violation detection**
- **Retry delay extraction** from API errors
- **Better logging** for debugging
- **Request deduplication** with shorter timeouts (10 seconds)

### **3. Improved Performance**
- **Real-time streaming** without artificial delays
- **Faster UI responsiveness** with reduced debouncing
- **Better request handling** with shorter timeouts
- **Enhanced error recovery** for quota issues

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Current Configuration**

The streaming is now configured for maximum responsiveness:

```typescript
// Chat polling intervals (in milliseconds)
refetchInterval: 2000, // Faster polling for better responsiveness
staleTime: 1000, // Keep data fresh for 1 second
gcTime: 5000, // Keep cache for 5 seconds

// UI debouncing (in milliseconds)
debounce: 300, // Reduced debounce for better responsiveness

// Request deduplication (in seconds)
requestTimeout: 10, // Shorter timeout for faster response
maxAttempts: 60, // Max attempts to wait for stream cleanup
attemptDelay: 500, // Delay between cleanup attempts
```

## üéØ **Key Improvements**

### **1. Real-Time Streaming**
- Removed all artificial delays between chunks
- Direct stream processing without slowStream wrapper
- Immediate response streaming for better user experience

### **2. Faster UI Updates**
- Reduced polling interval from 3s to 2s
- Reduced debouncing from 500ms to 300ms
- Faster state updates and responsiveness

### **3. Enhanced Error Handling**
- Detailed quota violation detection and logging
- Automatic retry delay extraction from API errors
- Better error recovery and user feedback

### **4. Improved Request Management**
- Shorter request deduplication timeouts
- Better cleanup of processing states
- Enhanced stream abort handling

## üîß **Performance Characteristics**

### **Streaming Speed:**
- **Real-time** - No artificial delays
- **Immediate** chunk processing
- **Fast** step transitions

### **UI Responsiveness:**
- **2-second** polling intervals
- **300ms** debouncing
- **1-second** stale time

### **Error Recovery:**
- **10-second** request timeouts
- **60 attempts** for cleanup
- **500ms** between attempts
