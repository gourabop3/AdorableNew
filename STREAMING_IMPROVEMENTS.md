# Streaming Improvements

## üöÄ **Fixed Issues**

### **1. Too Fast Streaming**
- **Problem**: AI responses were streaming too fast to read
- **Solution**: Added configurable delays between chunks and steps
- **Result**: More readable, natural-feeling streaming

### **2. UI Blinking**
- **Problem**: Chat interface was flickering and blinking
- **Solution**: Improved debouncing, polling intervals, and state management
- **Result**: Smooth, stable UI experience

### **3. Message Disappearing**
- **Problem**: Messages were disappearing or not showing properly
- **Solution**: Better stream resumption handling and state tracking
- **Result**: Reliable message display and persistence

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Configuration**

All streaming settings are now centralized in `src/lib/streaming-config.ts`:

```typescript
export const STREAMING_CONFIG = {
  // Chat polling intervals (in milliseconds)
  POLLING: {
    REFETCH_INTERVAL: 3000, // How often to check stream state
    STALE_TIME: 2000, // How long to keep data fresh
    GC_TIME: 10000, // How long to keep cache
  },
  
  // UI debouncing (in milliseconds)
  DEBOUNCE: {
    RUNNING_STATE: 500, // Debounce for running state changes
    MESSAGE_SENDING: 200, // Delay before sending message
    SENDING_RESET: 1000, // Time to reset sending state
  },
  
  // Stream speed control (in milliseconds)
  STREAMING: {
    CHUNK_DELAY: 30, // Delay between stream chunks
    STEP_DELAY: 100, // Delay between AI steps
    CHUNK_PROCESSING: 50, // Delay in chunk processing
  },
  
  // Request deduplication (in seconds)
  DEDUPLICATION: {
    REQUEST_TIMEOUT: 10, // How long to track duplicate requests
    MAX_ATTEMPTS: 60, // Max attempts to wait for stream cleanup
    ATTEMPT_DELAY: 500, // Delay between cleanup attempts
  }
};
```

## üéØ **Key Improvements**

### **1. Slower, More Readable Streaming**
- Added 30ms delay between stream chunks
- Added 100ms delay between AI processing steps
- Added 50ms delay in chunk processing

### **2. Better UI Stability**
- Increased polling interval from 2s to 3s
- Increased debounce from 300ms to 500ms
- Better state management to prevent flickering

### **3. Improved Message Handling**
- Added sending state to prevent duplicate messages
- Better stream resumption with delays
- Improved error handling and cleanup

### **4. Enhanced Performance**
- Longer cache times (10s instead of 5s)
- Better request deduplication
- Optimized re-rendering prevention

## üîß **How to Adjust Speed**

### **Make Streaming Faster:**
```typescript
STREAMING: {
  CHUNK_DELAY: 10, // Reduce from 30ms
  STEP_DELAY: 50,  // Reduce from 100ms
  CHUNK_PROCESSING: 20, // Reduce from 50ms
}
```

### **Make Streaming Slower:**
```typescript
STREAMING: {
  CHUNK_DELAY: 50, // Increase from 30ms
  STEP_DELAY: 200, // Increase from 100ms
  CHUNK_PROCESSING: 100, // Increase from 50ms
}
```

### **Reduce UI Blinking:**
```typescript
POLLING: {
  REFETCH_INTERVAL: 5000, // Increase from 3000ms
  STALE_TIME: 3000, // Increase from 2000ms
}
DEBOUNCE: {
  RUNNING_STATE: 800, // Increase from 500ms
}
```

## ‚úÖ **Testing**

The improvements have been tested to ensure:
- ‚úÖ AI responses are readable and not too fast
- ‚úÖ UI doesn't blink or flicker
- ‚úÖ Messages don't disappear
- ‚úÖ No duplicate message sending
- ‚úÖ Smooth streaming experience
- ‚úÖ Proper error handling

## üöÄ **Result**

Your chat now provides a much better user experience with:
- **Readable streaming speed**
- **Stable UI without blinking**
- **Reliable message handling**
- **Smooth performance**
- **Easy configuration**
